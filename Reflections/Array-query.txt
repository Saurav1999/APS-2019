
Array Query Efficient Solutions:
1. Look-Up table technique:
	• Holds values which would otherwise need to be calculated.
	• Replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation (memoization).
	• Processing time - Variable (depends upon type of problem being solved)
	• Fetch Time: O(1)
2. Square root decomposition:
	• Based on decomposition of array into smaller blocks. 
	• Reduce Time Complexity by a factor of sqrt(n) (Worst case:O(sqrt(n) i.e when range completely overlaps all the blocks.)	
	• Pre-rocessing time - O(n)
3. Segment Tree:
	• A binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments.	
	• Bottom-up approach.
	• Divide and conquer based.
	• Time complexity O(log(n))

If we want just the coefficient with a given n and k value we can use recursive or 1-d dynamic version:

1) Recursive version
	
		 calculation of binomial coefficient can be broken down to two sub tasks
		 i.e C(n,k)=C(n-1,k-1)+C(n-1,k)
	
		 memory occupied is more that is (2^n-1)*(memory required for 1st recursive call )
			1	2^0
		       /  \	
		      1    1    2^1
		     /  \ /  \		 
	       	     1  1 1   1	2^2
				 .
				 .
				2^n-1
		memory isn't released until the program completely backtracks.
		
2) 1-d dynamic version
	
	The size occupied is lesser compared to recursive version  beacuse copy of same set of variables isn't created again and again.
	
	speed efficiency of 1d dynamic version is more  because reaching base condition each time takes more time than memorizing the previous state.
	
 	Time Complexity- O(n*k)

3) 2-d dynamic approach
	
	If we want to generate whole pascal tree than 2d dynamic array is used.
	
	space = n*k*sizeof(int)
